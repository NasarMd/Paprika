# Paprika
Paprika is a sample project which allows users to download and begin playing around with the Habanero (https://github.com/usman-h/Habanero) Test Automation framework.

Habanero is an Open Source testing framework that uses Cucumber-JVM, Selenium WebDriver, JUnit, Appium and other lesser known libraries. It is fully Open Source and provides the ability to define and document test cases, write automated tests to be run against the UI, Services, Mobile applications and anything else you want to.

If you require any changes or wish to make some improvements to the Habanero framework, please Fork the repository and send a pull request. These changes will be reviewed and feedback provided within 48 hours.

This sample project utilises the latest version of Habanero and includes a few selected sample tests. The maintenance of the sample tests will be down to each individual who downloads the project. I will not be making regular changes to the tests, only when there is a big change to the framework which affects how test code is written will I maintain this project.

The idea of having Paprika is to allow users starting off with test automation a starting point to download it locally and have a play around with getting to know how to write automated tests. 
This should be used as such, not for a real programme but for personal training use.
